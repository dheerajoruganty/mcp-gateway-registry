## What is MCP Gateway & Registry?

The **MCP Gateway & Registry** is an enterprise-ready platform that centralizes access to AI development tools using the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction). Instead of managing hundreds of individual tool configurations across your development teams, provide secure, governed access to curated AI tools through a single platform.

**Transform this chaos:**
```
‚ùå Each developer configures VS Code, Cursor, Claude Code individually
‚ùå Scattered API keys and credentials across tools  
‚ùå No visibility into what tools teams are using
‚ùå Security risks from unmanaged tool sprawl
```

**Into this organized approach:**
```
‚úÖ Centralized tool catalog with enterprise governance
‚úÖ Single sign-on through your identity provider
‚úÖ Complete audit trail and compliance ready
‚úÖ Consistent developer experience across all AI assistants
```

---

## Core Use Cases

### AI Development Tool Governance
Provide developers with secure access to approved AI development tools while maintaining IT oversight and compliance.

### Enterprise Security & Compliance  
Centralized authentication, fine-grained permissions, and comprehensive audit trails for SOX/GDPR compliance pathways.

### Dynamic Tool Discovery
AI agents can autonomously discover and execute specialized tools beyond their initial capabilities using intelligent semantic search.

### Microservices Integration
Seamlessly integrate with existing enterprise architecture including Amazon Cognito, SAML, and AWS services.

---

## Key Advantages

### **Enterprise-Grade Security**
- OAuth 2.0/3.0 compliance with IdP integration
- Fine-grained access control at tool and method level  
- Zero-trust network architecture
- Complete audit trails for compliance

### **Developer Experience**
- Single configuration works across VS Code, Cursor, Claude Code, Cline
- Dynamic tool discovery with natural language queries
- Instant onboarding for new team members
- Consistent experience across all AI coding assistants

### **Production Ready**
- High availability with multi-AZ deployment
- Container-native (Docker/Kubernetes)
- Real-time health monitoring and alerting
- Horizontal scaling support

### **Extensible & Open**
- Based on open Model Context Protocol standard
- Custom MCP server integration
- API-first design for programmatic management
- Plugin architecture for extensions

---

## Quick Start

Get up and running in 5 minutes with Docker Compose:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/agentic-community/mcp-gateway-registry.git
cd mcp-gateway-registry

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your Cognito credentials

# Generate authentication credentials
./credentials-provider/generate_creds.sh

# Deploy with Docker Compose
./build_and_run.sh

# Access the registry
open http://localhost:7860
```

**That's it!** Your enterprise MCP gateway is now running.
