## Quick Start

!!! tip "Prerequisites"
    Before proceeding, ensure you have satisfied all [prerequisites](installation.md#prerequisites) including Docker, AWS account setup, and Amazon Cognito configuration.

Get up and running in 5 minutes with Docker Compose:

```bash
# 1. Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/agentic-community/mcp-gateway-registry.git
cd mcp-gateway-registry

# 2. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your AWS Cognito credentials

# 3. Generate authentication credentials  
./credentials-provider/generate_creds.sh

# 4. Deploy with Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d

# 5. Access the registry
open http://localhost:7860
```

The registry will be available at `http://localhost:7860` with example MCP servers pre-configured.

The MCP Gateway & Registry acts as a centralized hub that:

1. **Authenticates** users and AI agents through OAuth providers
2. **Authorizes** access based on fine-grained scopes and permissions
3. **Routes** requests to appropriate MCP servers
4. **Monitors** server health and performance
5. **Discovers** available tools and capabilities dynamically

## Use Cases

### üè¢ Enterprise Integration
Transform how both autonomous AI agents and development teams access enterprise systems:

- **Unified Access Point**: Single endpoint for all MCP servers across your organization
- **Enterprise SSO**: Integration with existing identity providers (Cognito, SAML, OIDC)
- **Compliance & Governance**: Comprehensive audit trails and access control policies
- **Scalable Architecture**: Support for hundreds of MCP servers and thousands of concurrent users

### ü§ñ AI Agent Workflows
Enable sophisticated AI agent interactions with enterprise systems:

- **Dynamic Tool Discovery**: Agents discover and utilize tools based on current context
- **Intelligent Tool Selection**: AI-powered recommendations for optimal tool usage
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Shared access to enterprise resources with conflict resolution
- **Context-Aware Permissions**: Dynamic access control based on agent capabilities and current task

### üë©‚Äçüíª Development Team Productivity
Accelerate development workflows with integrated tooling:

- **IDE Integration**: Native support for VS Code, Cursor, and Claude Code
- **Real-Time Collaboration**: Shared access to development tools and services
- **Environment Management**: Consistent tool access across development, staging, and production
